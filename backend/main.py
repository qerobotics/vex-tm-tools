"""FastAPI app factory + lifespan (plan §B.10 / §C.2).

Per §C.2, this is the ONLY file permitted to import and instantiate
`LeaderElection`, `AutomationEngine`, `TimerManager`, `Scraper`, `Predictor`,
and the `Loader`, and to wire `on_promoted`/`on_demoted` callbacks.

Wave 2b added `TimerManager` (`backend.modules.timer.manager`) to that
wiring alongside the `LeaderElection` Wave 1 already built. Wave 3a
(Automation Engine) adds the `Loader` (`backend.loader`) and
`AutomationEngine` (`backend.modules.automation.engine`) the same way:
instantiated here, started/stopped from `on_promoted`/`on_demoted`, exposed
on `app.state` only while this node is the leader. Wave 3b adds the
auth/RBAC/integrations/overlays/settings routers and the `/ws/*` WebSocket
routes (and the `ConnectionManager`'s Redis fan-out, which runs on every
node regardless of leadership — see comment below). Wave 4b wires in
`Scraper` (`backend.modules.scraper.scraper`) and `Predictor`
(`backend.modules.predictor.predictor`) the same way.

Run with (per Appendix B.1 — exactly 1 worker per pod):

    uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 1
